I am a web developer with a background in data processing and analytics.

For me, programming is a natural extension of my experience and education. I love being able to to turn logic into applications that bring meaning and value to people.

When I’m not glued to my computer, I love being in nature – hiking and biking are favorite activities. I also enjoy yoga and dance, and snuggling with my cats.
